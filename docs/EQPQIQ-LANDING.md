## 4. AI Analytics — From Narratives to Structured Insights

**Label:** AI-Powered Analytics

**Title:** From Narratives to Structured Insights

**Subtitle:** Evaluation comments are rich but hard to aggregate. Our AI mid-layer transforms unstructured narratives into quantified EQ·PQ·IQ scores, SWOT analyses, and actionable recommendations—while maintaining full privacy.

### Steps

1. **Collect** — Faculty evaluations, self-assessments, and structured ratings flow into the system from forms, imports, or existing LMS integrations.

2. **Anonymize & Analyze** — Identifiers are stripped before AI analysis. Claude reads narratives and produces evidence-based SWOT elements with severity levels, supporting quotes, and confidence scores.

3. **Score & Visualize** — AI scores all 15 EQ·PQ·IQ attributes (1.0–5.0), generates period-over-period trendlines, and surfaces gap analysis between self and observer ratings.

4. **Act** — Program directors and evaluators receive radar charts, SWOT dashboards, archetype classifications, and targeted recommendations—ready for coaching conversations or Clinical Competency Committee meetings.

## 5. Archetyping — Classify Trajectories, Not Just Levels

**Label:** Archetyping

**Title:** Classify Trajectories, Not Just Levels

**Subtitle:** A single score at one point in time tells you very little. EQ·PQ·IQ tracks performance trajectories—year over year—and classifies individuals into actionable archetypes so support is targeted, not generic.

### Archetypes

| Archetype | Description | Risk |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| Elite Performer | Consistently high. Leadership and fellowship track. | Low |
| Breakthrough | Major improvement year-over-year. Document what worked. | Low |
| Late Bloomer | Low start but positive trajectory. Encourage continuation. | Low |
| Steady Climber | Consistent gains each year. Maintain approach. | Low |
| Peak & Decline | Improved then dropped. Investigate underlying factors. | High |
| Late Struggle | Strong start, late decline. Assess burnout and support. | Moderate |
| Continuous Decline | Declining trajectory. Intensive intervention needed. | High |
| Variable | Unique pattern. Individualized approach required. | Moderate |

**Footer note:** Each archetype includes confidence scores, similar historical profiles, methodology versioning, and specific recommendations for coaching, mentorship, and intervention.

## 6. Longitudinal Value — Growth Over Time, Not Snapshots
