# Elevate (lev8.ai) - Project Context for Claude/Cursor

## Project Overview
Healthcare platform for medical residency programs. Emergency Medicine focus.
Voice journal with AI transcription (Whisper) and summarization (Claude).

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- Tailwind CSS
- OpenAI Whisper API (transcription)
- Claude API (summarization)

## Key Directories
- `app/api/` - API routes (use route.ts inside folders)
- `app/(dashboard)/` - Protected dashboard pages
- `app/(auth)/` - Login/register pages
- `components/` - React components
- `lib/` - Utilities (supabase.ts, etc.)

## Coding Standards
- TypeScript strict mode always
- Use `console.log('[ComponentName]', ...)` for debugging
- API routes must be in `route.ts` files (Next.js 14 requirement)
- User profiles use `full_name` column (not first_name/last_name)
- Residents table required for voice journal functionality

## Database Schema Notes
- `user_profiles` - base user info (all roles)
- `residents` - resident-specific data (links to programs)
- `grow_voice_journal` - voice entries (owner-only via RLS)
- `programs` - residency programs
- `health_systems` - institutions

## Common Issues
- Residents table must exist for voice journal
- Storage bucket `voice_journal` must be created in Supabase
- API routes need SERVICE_KEY not ANON_KEY for full access
- Audio MIME type varies by browser (webm/ogg/mp4)

## Current State
- Registration working
- Voice journal UI complete
- Need to test end-to-end: record → transcribe → summarize
- Authentication temporarily simplified (2FA disabled)
