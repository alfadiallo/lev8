### 2. EQ + PQ + IQ Tab

**What it shows:**
- Emotional, Professional, and Intellectual Quotient scores
- 15-point radar chart visualization
- Faculty vs Self-assessment comparison
- Gap analysis
- ITE score history

**Features:**

**15-Point Radar Chart:**
- Visualizes all 15 attributes on one comprehensive chart
- Color-coded sections:
  - **EQ (Pink):** Empathy, Adaptability, Stress Management, Curiosity, Communication
  - **PQ (Teal):** Work Ethic, Integrity, Teachability, Documentation, Leadership
  - **IQ (Green):** Knowledge Base, Analytical Thinking, Learning, Flexibility, Performance
- Faculty data (blue line) overlaid with Self data (pink line)
- Interactive tooltips on hover
- Scale: 1.0-5.0

**How to Read the Radar Chart:**

1. **Look for Shape:**
   - Balanced shape = well-rounded resident
   - Spikes = exceptional in specific areas
   - Dips = areas needing improvement

2. **Compare Faculty vs Self:**
   - Overlapping lines = good self-awareness
   - Self higher than faculty = potential overconfidence
   - Faculty higher than self = potential underconfidence

3. **Identify Patterns:**
   - All EQ attributes low = emotional intelligence focus needed
   - All PQ attributes high = strong professionalism
   - All IQ attributes variable = inconsistent clinical performance

**Gap Analysis:**
- Shows difference between self and faculty perception
- Three metrics: EQ gap, PQ gap, IQ gap
- Color-coded:
  - **Green:** Small gap (< 0.5) - Good self-awareness
  - **Yellow:** Moderate gap (0.5-1.0) - Some blind spots
  - **Red:** Large gap (> 1.0) - Significant perception mismatch

**Interpreting Gaps:**
- **Positive Gap (Self > Faculty):** Resident may be overconfident
- **Negative Gap (Faculty > Self):** Resident may be underconfident or overly self-critical
- **Large Gaps:** Indicate blind spots; use in coaching conversations

**Detailed Scores Table:**
- Shows exact values for all 15 attributes
- Faculty average (from multiple evaluators)
- Self-assessment value
- Number of faculty raters

**ITE Scores:**
- Historical exam performance
- Percentile rankings
- Trend over time
- Compare to national averages

**How to Use:**

   - Create specific action plans
   - Set target scores for next period
   - Track progress over time
